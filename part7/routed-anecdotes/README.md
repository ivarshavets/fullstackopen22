# Project Anecdote with react router

### Version 7 ([exercise 7.1-7.3](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7/react_router#exercises-7-1-7-3))


1. Add React Router to the application:
- By clicking links in the Menu component the view should be changed.
- At the root of the application, meaning the path /, show the list of anecdotes.
- The Footer component should always be visible at the bottom.
- The creation of a new anecdote should happen e.g. in the path create

2. Implement a view for showing a single anecdote. Navigating to the page showing the single anecdote is done by clicking the name of that anecdote.

3. Improve the functionality of an anecdote creation such that after creating a new anecdote the application transitions automatically to showing the view for all anecdotes and the user is shown a notification informing them of this successful creation for the next five seconds:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
